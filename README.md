This was forked from carsongee's repo "junk."  It creates a landing page website with continually-updated inspiring images and quotes and contains links in tab form to frequently-visited sites (specified by the user).  I forked it to make it suit my own likes/needs as a self-guided tutorial for getting exposed to new programming languages.
